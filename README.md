# perishable-goods-prediction
Built a smart demand forecasting tool for perishable grocery items using sales, weather, and calendar data. Cleaned data, handled outliers, trained a LightGBM model, and created a user input script to predict daily sales. Final insights were visualized in Tableau to support store-level decisions.
